Part of the reason I love being a coder is the community. So here are some miscellaneous scripts and mini projects I've done. Maybe someone can use them for something, maybe they're just really good backup for myself and I've decided to just store them publicly.

Items in this repo:

- updateDNS [python] - A script I run with a cronjob to check my IP and update a nameserver A record on DigitalOcean (because I do not have a static IP address)
- reactplayground [node,react,mongo] - A playground for learning React.js
